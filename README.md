# FermiNet-Extended: A Scalable Neural Architecture for Many-Fermion Quantum Systems

**FermiNet-Extended** is a systematically enhanced version of DeepMind's open-source FermiNet framework.  
This project aims to create a more general-purpose and adaptable platform for studying many-body fermionic wavefunctions and their dynamics in various physical systems, including both **condensed matter** and **high-energy physics** domains.

###  Extended Support for Physical Wavefunctions

- **Laughlin Wavefunctions**  
  For strongly correlated 2D electron systems in the fractional quantum Hall regime.

- **BCS-Type Superconducting States**  
  Simulating Cooper pair formation and superconducting phases.

- **Custom Pairing Functions**  
  Extending the modelâ€™s ability to represent many-body correlation structures beyond Slater determinants.

---

###  Network Architecture Redesign

- Modular redesign to support both **lattice-based** and **continuous-space** systems.
- Interfaces for **periodic boundary conditions**, **symmetry constraints**, and flexible basis functions.
- Configurable architecture with full control over depth, layer types, and interaction terms.

---

###  Large-Scale Training Experiments

- Executed on the [Hoffman2 Supercomputing Cluster](https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/) at UCLA.
- Benchmarks conducted across atomic and molecular systems with multiple wavefunction forms.
- Comparative evaluations on energy convergence and generalization performance.
